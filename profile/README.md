AntV ![stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/antvis?style=social), initiated by Ant Group and open-sourced starting in 2017, reimagines data visualization by embedding the theory of graphical grammar into the JavaScript language. In response to rigid chart libraries that force a trade-off between flexibility and usability, we have categorized data visualization techniques into four series: 2, 6, 7, and 8, which respectively represent _statistical analysis_, _graph analysis_, _geographical analysis_, and _unstructured data visualization_. We have expanded these capabilities across different levels, including chart libraries, R&D tools, and AI-powered intelligent visualization.

## 🎖️ Visualization series

- **Series 2**: statistical analysis, named from **G**rammar of **G**raphics, contains [G2](https://github.com/antvis/G2), [S2](https://github.com/antvis/S2), [F2](https://github.com/antvis/F2).
- **Series 6**: graph analysis and editing, named from 「Six Degrees of Separation」, contains [G6](https://github.com/antvis/G6), [X6](https://github.com/antvis/X6).
- **Series 7**: geographical analysis, named from 「The Earth has 7 continents」, contains [L7](https://github.com/antvis/L7).
- **Series 8**: unstructured data visualization, named from 「Möbius strip」or 「1 byte has 8 bits」, contains T8, [A8](https://github.com/antvis/A8), M8.
- **AI-powered intelligent visualization**: contains [AVA](https://github.com/antvis/AVA), [GPT-Vis](https://github.com/antvis/GPT-Vis) and [mcp-server-chart](https://github.com/antvis/mcp-server-chart).
